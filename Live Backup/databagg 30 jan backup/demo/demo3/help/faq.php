<p>File syncing and computer backup are two very different features. It is important to not confuse the two.</p>

<p><strong>Backup:</strong> takes a copy of the file and uploads it to our servers for safe keeping, you can get your files back at any time if you accidentally delete or lose a file by downloading from the online control panel or restoring via the desktop application.</p>

<p><strong>Sync:</strong> Allows you to sync the same files between multiple computers, syncing mirrors a folder on one computer on another.</p>

<p>Create a new sync folder. If there are just a few files that you want synced in a specific location on your computer, create a new folder and then drag and drop these files to that folder. Then, sync that folder</p>
